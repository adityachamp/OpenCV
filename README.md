# OpenCV

Exercise1:
A program reads the cvMat object from rows to column to type. The order of the pixel structure is bit depth, models of color spaces, and number of channels.


Exercise2: 
2: range of pixels is 0-255

Exercise4:
2: Disadvantage of binary thresholding is that it filters out all other values other than 1's and 0's. Hence,we may encounter a loss of information.
