# OpenCV

Exercise1:
A program reads the cvMat object from rows to column to type. The order of the pixel structure is bit depth, models of color spaces, and number of channels.


Exercise2: 
2: range of pixels is 0-255

Exercise4:
2: Disadvantage of binary thresholding is that it filters out all other values other than 1's and 0's. Hence,we may encounter a loss of information.

Exercise4:
3:In simple thresholding, the threshold value is global, i.e., it is same for all the pixels in the image. Adaptive thresholding is the method where the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions and therefore, there will be different threshold values for different regions.
